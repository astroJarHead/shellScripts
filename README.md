# Unix/Linux shell scripts

I store some shell scripts here that I wrote or used and find useful. Use at your own risk :)

## my_rsync.sh

This script runs an rsync back-up fromone "machine" to another "machine" as a Bash sh script. 
A logfile is written and stored to a directory of log-files to record the backups conducted.
The user gets progress output to the command line as the script progresses so there is some feedback 
on the files backled up and the progress and time the script is taking to complete the task.
